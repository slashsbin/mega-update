# [WIP] This is a work-in-progress ansible-role, do NOT use in production yet.

---

Mega-Update
===========

TODO: A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------

TODO: Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

TODO: A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
- hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: slashsbin.mega_update }
```
